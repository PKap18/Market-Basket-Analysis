# Market-Basket-Analysis
A recommender syster for market basket analysis using Python

Ever looked for a product on amazon.com and scrolled down to end up seeing something which says- People who bought this..., also bought that or most frequently bought items?? Most of us have seen this and experienced it. At times, we have been driven by that suggestion as well. 

Often when we do online shopping, the marketing teams, analysts, data scientists have this one case to look into, when it comes to better strategizing the sale of products and targeting a revenue increase – finding key product pair(s) that are frequently bought together and then suggest/recommend customers based on their findings. This can be achieved by a well know algorithm – Apriori Algorithm. Market Basket Analysis is an application of this algorithm.

In the python code, I have used mlxtend library to perform market basket analysis using the apriori algorithm present in the mlxtend library. Input is the data from a retail store which has data about the products purchased for various set of countries. I have kept it to a one country for a quick analysis purpose. 

You can also use 'apyori' library which also provides apriori function to perform market basket analysis. 
For a brief and quick understanding of market basket analysis and using aprori using apyori lib, you can look at my blog on medium
